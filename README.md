# MazeSwarm
This repository contains the code used to create a randamised maze like environment created to investigate the effects of the communication between agents in multi-agents reinforcement learning.

This is done using [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).
